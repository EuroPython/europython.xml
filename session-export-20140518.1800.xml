&#13;
We start by writing a minimal functional test using Selenium, and using it to test that we've got Django installed, and its dev server up and running on our local PC.&#13;
&#13;
We make our initial commit with the Django project and its functional test file. The Testing Goat is introduced.&#13;
&#13;
## Part 2 -- Switching to unittest&#13;
&#13;
We convert our FT to using the unittest module, including setUp, tearDown and some of the unittest assertion helper functions.&#13;
&#13;
## Part 3 -- Unit tests for a simple front page&#13;
&#13;
Next we start building the front page of our site. We learn how to use the Django test runner, and how to write a unit test which tests a Django view.&#13;
We do some intitial config in Django's settings.py, and then learn about urls.py and views.py.&#13;
We learn the feel of the unit test - code cycle, where we write code with small, incremental changes, re-running the tests each time.&#13;
&#13;
## Part 4 -- Switch to templates, refactoring, and discuss TDD philosophy&#13;
&#13;
A moment's reflection on what we test and why -- what functional tests are for, how they differ from unit tests, what we should and shouldn't test, and discuss the merits of testing trivial functions.&#13;
&#13;
We then switch our home page view from building HTML out of strings to using a template.&#13;
We learn how Django templates work, and what "proper" refactoring is. Refactoring Cat is introduced&#13;
&#13;
## Part 5 -- Processing user input using forms, POST and database models&#13;
&#13;
We learn how to use Selenium to simulate user input to our site.&#13;
We start to build up a simple solution to process user submissions using an HTML form, a POST request. We take a few wrong turns along the way, and see how TDD guides us towards the right answer.&#13;
&#13;
## Part 6 -- Better design using related models and multiple views.&#13;
&#13;
We fix our broken implementation from the previous section, using incremental, step-by-step changes to the code.&#13;
We learn how to make changes to the code in such a way that we always go from working state to working state.&#13;
&#13;
We also learn about foreign key relationships, and a simple REST-ish URL structure, with several simple views each doing one job well.&#13;
&#13;
Further topics, if time permits:&#13;
&#13;
- layout and styling using Bootstrap CSS framework&#13;
- mocks&#13;
- continuous integration (Jenkins introduction)&#13;
- deployment!&#13;

=======&#13;
&#13;
To help create award winning visual effects, MPC developed a distributed service-oriented platform, Amanda.&#13;
Amanda allows developers of any level to write a service that is presented to users across 8 facilities globally without them requiring any&#13;
knowledge of building large concurrent systems. It allows artists and developers across different domains to work with&#13;
clearly defined API's and gives the service developer control over what and how data can and should be accessed.&#13;
&#13;
The talk will cover how to set up such a platform from the ground up. Starting at the service level building it out with&#13;
additional modules and technologies until the fully distributed system, including our monitoring and tracing approach&#13;
as well as the componetisation that allows swapping any of the modules in order to fine tune the&#13;
setup depending on the type of work being undertaken and changing business needs.</description><speakers><speaker id="373"><name>Jozef van Eenbergen</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/373/</profile><description>Jozef has been working with Python since 2009 and programming with different languages since 2005.

&#13;
There are many virtualisation software packages that let you create VMs, for example *virt-manager* (Linux), *Vagrant* (Linux, Windows, Mac Os X) or *Virtual Box* (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X). You should install Fedora 20 or Ubuntu 12.04 in the virtual machine.&#13;
The installation instructions for DevStack are available at [http://devstack.org](http://devstack.org) : within the VM, clone the repository then run `./stack.sh`.&#13;
&#13;
If you have a problem installing DevStack we can try and solve it during the day - doing one run-through of `stack.sh` will at least ensure all the packages and software have been downloaded (save the VM!).&#13;

Structure:&#13;
----------&#13;
**30 minutes - Introduction**&#13;
&#13;
  Introduction to OpenStack and to the session goals&#13;
&#13;
  Environment check, start devstack&#13;
&#13;
**30 minutes - Setting up**&#13;
&#13;
  Creating accounts:&#13;
&#13;
  - Launchpad (used for bug tracking)&#13;
  - The Foundation&#13;
  - Gerrit + CLA (it uses the launchpad account, explanation of how gerrit is used, review team vs committer team)&#13;
  - Key pair&#13;
&#13;
  Devstack tips&#13;
&#13;
**30 minutes - Getting started**&#13;
&#13;
  How to choose a bug, bug trackers, low hanging fruits&#13;
&#13;
  Reminder of the different OpenStack projects mentioned in the introduction, as well as the documentation and integration tests&#13;
&#13;
  Each participant should pick a project and download the code for that project&#13;
&#13;
  Ways to find an easy bug:&#13;
&#13;
  - low-hanging-fruit&#13;
  - general bug tracker browsing&#13;
  - adding a unit test&#13;
  - developer docs also live in the project's repository (typos, clarifications, etc)&#13;
&#13;
**10 minutes - Break**&#13;
&#13;
**45 minutes - Find &amp; work on a bug**&#13;
&#13;
  Participants work on a small task.&#13;
&#13;
  There'll be a few tasks ready for people who struggle to find something (missing tests, mostly) but it's unlikely there will be one ready in advance for everyone. Participants will be strongly encouraged to find a task of their own based on their interests and the advice shared prior to the break.&#13;
&#13;
**35 minutes - Submitting the patch**&#13;

It's becoming&#13;
quite difficult to keep track of all the different components an application&#13;
needs to function (a database, an AMQP, a web server, a document store...). It keeps getting harder and harder to setup new development environments and to bring new developers into the team. Stuff works on one dev machine but doesn't on others? Code breaks often when deployed to production even though all tests were passing and it worked on the dev machine?&#13;
&#13;
The idea of this talk is to convey how important it is that we have our development environment as close to production as possible. That means setting up all those various services on your laptop/workstation.&#13;
&#13;
In this talk I am going to show how to utilize light weight lxc containers&#13;
using docker, and make your development process much more straightforward. How to share container images among your development team and be sure that everyone is running the exact same stack. Do all this without hogging too many resources, without the need for complex provisioning scripts and management systems. And above all else, how to do it fast!</description><speakers><speaker id="429"><name>Deni Bertovic</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/429/</profile><description>Software Engineer from Zagreb, Croatia, currently focusing mainly on Python, but I enjoy learning about Clojure, Haskell and FP languages in general.

It provides a seamless two-way data binding between the Python model and the HTML view by creating a Python-JS communication bridge. This ensures that the view is always live as it can automatically update itself when the model changes, and update the model when user actions take place on the UI. The Jigna view can be rendered in an in-process Qt widget or over the web in a browser.</description><speakers><speaker id="215"><name>Prashant Agrawal</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/215/</profile><description>I am a software developer at Enthought India in Mumbai.

&#13;
We will build API iteratively, while creating our AngularJS app. Along the way, we will look into bottlenecks and pitfalls that await you once you step beyond the trivial "hello world" apps.&#13;
&#13;
The main takeaway of the talk: listeners should obtain enough info to have an *informed* opinion whether AngularJS is easy enough to choose for their next project.</description><speakers><speaker id="41"><name>Victor Farazdagi</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/41/</profile><description>- Graduate student at Georgia Tech&#13;

One of the main tenets of OpenStack is the (Shared Nothing Architecture) to which all modules stick very closely. In order to do that, services within OpenStack have adopted different strategies to integrate themselves and share data without sacrificing performance nor moving away from SNA.&#13;
&#13;
This strategies are not applicable just to OpenStack but to any distributed system. Sharing data, regardless what that data is, is a must-have requirement of any successful cloud service.&#13;
&#13;
This talk will present some of the existing integration strategies that are applicable to cloud infrastructures and enterprise services. The talk will be based on the strategies that have helped OpenStack to be successful and most importantly, scalable.&#13;

But it is not the only case! When you have a big system, you need to test it on much higher level - if only to check if all the components are wired in the right way. You may do it manually, but it is tedious and time-consuming - so you want to automate it. And here comes Python - the language of choice in many QA departments.</description><speakers><speaker id="314"><name>Katarzyna Jachim</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/314/</profile><description>Quality Engineer by choice, Python fanboy, coding style freak.&#13;

The triplet [R](http://www.r-project.org "R"), [Rserve](https://rforge.net/Rserve/ "Rserve"), and [pyRserve](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyRserve/ "pyRserve") allows the building up of a network bridge from Python to R: Now R-functions can be called from Python as if they were implemented in Python, and even complete R scripts can be executed through this connection.</description><speakers><speaker id="686"><name>Ralph Heinkel</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/686/</profile><description>Freelance Python software developer,&#13;

 &#13;
 More and more applications nowadays try to adopt the loosely coupled and distributed web like architecture by using hypermedia as an engine of the application state.&#13;
 &#13;
In Sky we are successfully implementing this approach for some of our components, and we&#8217;ve learnt that the major benefit for us is the scalability that it offers: as an increasingly expanding business with a constantly growing product portfolio, scalability of all our systems is crucial.&#13;
 &#13;
In this talk I will share some of the things we learnt, I will explain what hypermedia enabled API means, I will give an example of such an API and I will take you through the implementation details and the usage of flask, dougrain and HAL in this context.&#13;
 &#13;
Also, I will present a brief comparison with an API that is not hypermedia enabled and take you through the advantages of using the first approach.</description><speakers><speaker id="224"><name>Adriana Vasiu</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/224/</profile><description>I currently work as a Senior Software Developer for BskyB London and my programming skills vary.

In some scenarios is more convenient to store our data as a graph, because we want to extract and study information relative to these connections. In this scenario, graph databases are the ideal, they are designed and implemented to deal with connected information in a efficient way.</description><speakers><speaker id="175"><name>Francisco Fern&#225;ndez Casta&#241;o</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/175/</profile><description>I work as software engineer at biicode in Madrid, Python is my main programming language but I also program in other languages like Erlang, Haskell, Clojure...

He described how developers, in light of the Snowden surveillance revelations, ought to learn about and build decentralized peer-to-peer systems with strong cryptography.&#13;
&#13;
This talk introduces, describes and demonstrates both concepts and code that a group of Pythonistas have been working on since Holger's keynote. &#13;
&#13;
We asked ourselves two questions: what are the fundamental elements / abstractions of a peer-to-peer application and, given a reasonable answer to the first question, can we make a small and simple framework to facilitate the easy creation of peer-to-peer applications? Put another way, imagine a peer-to-peer equivalent of web frameworks like Django or Flask.&#13;
&#13;
We will present work done so far, discuss the sorts of application that might be written using such a  framework and explore how peer-to-peer technology could be both attractive and viable from an economic point of view.</description><speakers><speaker id="58"><name>Nicholas Tollervey</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/58/</profile><description>Classically trained musician, philosophy graduate, teacher, writer and software developer.

You will get tidbits of highly relevant information for the real world without having to plunge into academic information retrieval tomes.  &#13;
&#13;
While Elasticsearch makes Lucene easily available in a distributed setting, it helps to have some knowledge about the underlying algorithms and data structures. Understanding how these data structures are *used* makes implementing search easier. Knowing how the indexes are *built* helps you keep things reliably performant.&#13;
&#13;
The key data structure in search is the powerful and versatile inverted index, which is actually simple and not too hard to understand.  We will start there, then ascend through the abstraction layers until we end up with an overview of how a distributed search cluster processes searches and changes.</description><speakers><speaker id="504"><name>Alex Brasetvik</name><profile>https://ep2014.europython.eu//en/accounts/profile/504/</profile><description>Alex Brasetvik is a founder and senior software engineer at Found AS - a company whose primary product is a hosted Elasticsearch service.
