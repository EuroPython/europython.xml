<profile>Valerio Maggio has a PhD. in Computational Science from the University of Naples “Federico II” and he is currently a Postdoc researcher at the University of Salerno. His research interests are mainly focused on Unsupervised Machine Learning and Software Engineering, recently combined with Semantic Web technologies for linked data and big data analysis. 

Valerio started developing open source software in 2004, when he was a bachelor degree student. In 2006, he wrote his first lines of Python in his favourite Vim-based developing environment. From then on, he contributed to several open source projects in this language. Currently he uses Python as the mainstream language for his machine learning code, making an intensive use of Scikit-learn and Matplotlib to crunch, munge, and analyse experimental data.

He presented two talks at EuroPython 2012, and recently reviewed a book on Matplotlib that is going to be published.
Valerio is also a member of the Italian Python community, who enjoys a lot playing chess and drinking tea.</profile>

<name>Valerio Maggio</name>
<profile>Valerio Maggio has a PhD. in Computational Science from the University of Naples “Federico II” and he is currently a Postdoc researcher at the University of Salerno. His research interests are mainly focused on Unsupervised Machine Learning and Software Engineering, recently combined with Semantic Web technologies for linked data and big data analysis. 

Valerio started developing open source software in 2004, when he was a bachelor degree student. In 2006, he wrote his first lines of Python in his favourite Vim-based developing environment. From then on, he contributed to several open source projects in this language. Currently he uses Python as the mainstream language for his machine learning code, making an intensive use of Scikit-learn and Matplotlib to crunch, munge, and analyse experimental data.

the world of programming and picked up Amanda at MPC 3 years ago. As his first professional project in Python it exposed him to a lot of the different aspects of the language  (concurrency, databases, web, protocols). Working on Amanda brought back his passion and joy working on highly available and scaleable systems as he worked

Currently the principal developer on Amanda he loves the challenges the system and the many film projects throw him as the system grows bigger and bigger.

I have worked and contributed to the open source project dedupe https://github.com/open-city/dedupe when I was selected for Google Summer of Code 2013. I worked for "Code for America" organization. The project involved developing data matching tools in python using machine learning algorithms. I have also published a paper in LNCS in the field of Natural Language Processing (again data). I have also attended PyData London this year. Since last year I have regularly been organizing local Scientific Python Meetup on weekends in my college. We hack on projects and work with libraries not limited to scikit-learn, pandas, nltk, scipy. I am very enthusiastic about Python in education.</profile>

<profile>Erik has been a passionate software professional for 15 years, who considers software to be a craft, not science.

Launching his career in his native Amsterdam in 1999, he served as architect for a financial market data startup from its inception until acquisition. He then co-founded a not so successful Palo-Alto based online real-time video streaming startup. In a deliberate move back to more hands-on coding, Erik joined Atlassian in 2008 and relocated to Sydney, Australia. After having worked on various product teams, he joined the newly formed team to run Bitbucket after its acquisition since 2010.

Currently based out of San Francisco Erik continues to work on Bitbucket.
